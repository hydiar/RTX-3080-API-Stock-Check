# RTX-3080-API-Stock-Check
Written in Pyhton.

This bot was used for personal use only, to aid me purchasing a single RTX 3080 Founders Edition on launch. It has since not been used.

The script requires a twilio subscription for an SMS notification, you will need to replace the placeholder strings with your Twilio account SID and Auth Token, as well as the placeholder strings with your phone number to receive the notification.

This bot can be easily adapted to work with any open API with an in_stock variable.
